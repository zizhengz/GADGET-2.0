\title{Plot ICE + partial-dependence panels for every node in a tree}
\usage{
plot_tree(
  tree,
  effect,
  color_ice = "lightblue",
  color_pd = "lightcoral",
  target.feature,
  show.plot = TRUE,
  save.plot = FALSE,
  path = ".",
  file.prefix = "tree_plot"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A list-of-lists representing the fitted tree. Each
depth level is a list of node objects (as produced by
\code{compute_tree()}).}

\item{effect}{An \code{FeatureEffects} object created earlier in the pipeline that holds
centered ICE curves; must have a slot \code{$results} and a vector \code{$features}.}

\item{color_ice}{Color for ICE curves. Default \code{"lightblue"}.}

\item{color_pd}{Color for the PDP line. Default \code{"lightcoral"}.}

\item{target.feature}{Character string shown on the y-axis
(e.g.\ \code{"\\hat{f}_j"}). Passed down to
\code{regional_pd_plot()}.}

\item{show.plot}{Logical. Print each node panel to the active
graphics device? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{save.plot}{Logical. Save each node panel as a PDF file?
Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{path}{Path where PDFs are written (ignored if
\code{save.plot = FALSE}). Defaults to the current directory
\code{"."}.}

\item{file.prefix}{File name prefix for saved PDFs
(ignored unless \code{save.plot = TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A nested \code{list}. The top level is one entry per depth,
  named \code{"Depth_1"}, \code{"Depth_2"}, …; each contains a list
  of ggplot objects named \code{"Node_1"}, \code{"Node_2"}, ….
