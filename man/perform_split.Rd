\title{Compute the objective value of a candidate binary split}
\usage{
perform_split(split.points, xval, y, min.node.size, grid, objective, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{split.points}{Numeric vector of candidate cut points. Only the
first element is used after being adjusted by
\code{get_closest_point()}.}

\item{xval}{A single-column \code{data.frame} (or matrix) with the
feature values of the parent node.}

\item{y}{A list (usually per-feature ICE/ALE/SHAP matrices) that the
supplied \code{objective} function can understand.}

\item{min.node.size}{Integer. Minimum number of observations
required in each child node.}

\item{grid}{A named list of evaluation grids; the element
corresponding to the current feature is passed down to
\code{objective()} so that losses can be computed on the proper
subset of grid points.}

\item{objective}{Objective function with interface
\code{objective(y, x, split.feat, y.parent, grid, sub.number,
...)}. Must return a numeric scalar (or vector that can be summed).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments forwarded to \code{objective()}.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value: the summed objective of the two
  child nodes, or \code{Inf} if \code{min.node.size} is violated.
